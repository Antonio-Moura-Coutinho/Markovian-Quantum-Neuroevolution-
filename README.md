# Markovian-Quantum-Neuroevolution



**Project 5** : Neuroevolution, a field that draws inspiration from the evolution of brains in nature, harnesses evolutionary algorithms to construct artificial neural networks. 
It bears a number of intriguing capabilities that are typically inaccessible to gradient-based approaches, including optimizing neural-network architectures, hyperparameters, and even learning the training rules. Neuroevolution algorithms play an important role in artificial intelligence. Recently, a Markovian quantum neuroevolution algorithm has been introduced for designing variational quantum circuits Lu et al. (2021) and this algorithm has played a crucial role for the more recent realization of topological time crystals Zhang et al. (2022). 
However, a disadvantage of this algorithm concerns the time complexity at each generation: at a given generation, we need to train a number of randomly generated quantum variational circuits, which is highly time-consuming. 
It would be very interesting and important if you can adjust this algorithm to overcome this problem.
